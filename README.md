# WiDS Midterm Assignment – Data Analysis with Python

## Overview

This project is the midterm assignment for the **Winter in Data Science (WiDS)** mentor program.

The aim of this assignment was to perform basic data analysis using **Python and pandas**, visualize the data using plots, and write meaningful observations based on the results.
